# AOP-Airline-Management-Project
This is my first Java project in which i implemented classes and services used for managing an airline. 

From the main menu you can call two other menus: actions on people (customers and employees) and on flights and aircraft.
You can:
➙add, delete, see flights, airplanes, customers, coupons, employees and reservations.
➙search for a flight and a return for it depending on how many days you want to stay, the destination and the date of departure.
➙check the profit of a flight, if it has empty seats and they can be sorted.
➙see all the flights of a customer as well as of an employee,stored using a map.
I use two abstract classes: Booking and Person, but also two exceptions, for too many coupons and too many aircraft.
